US Hiking is the premier volunteer hiking organization in the United States. We organize hikes to many of the most beautiful and 
iconic locations around the country.
We promote hiking as a tool to improve physical and mental fitness because hiking is a process of overcoming challenges. To hike up a 
mountain is to conquer one's physical and mental limitation. We believe hiking could be a process to discover ourselves and to push the 
boundaries of our potential.
Our goal is to educate and train a new generation of hikers who are physically fit, mentally strong, and confident to face life's challenges.
US Hiking currently has 6 chapters: Los Angeles, Bay Area, Monterey, Ventura County, Orange County, and San Diego serving nearly 12,000 members. 
During hiking season, nearly 100 new members join our group every week, making US Hiking the fastest growing hiking group in the U.S.
